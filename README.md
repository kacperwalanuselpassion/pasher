Group ordering food? Get organized!

Often we order food to the office instead of eating out. Sometimes being more than 20 people, it has been a hassle and unnecessary distraction.
Thanks to El Pasher - each of us can post a link to whichever place he wants to order food from. Rest of employees automatically get a notice that this person is looking for someone to order with - as some restaurants require minimum order value - and quickly and easy add his choice.
Seems simple, but we have incorporated several features that make it even more brain-friendly:
- time boundaries so everyone knows exactly up to what time make up his mind,
- sharing single dish, especially usefull with (in)famous dish from Italy: pizza!,
- value of order displayed along with user's name to faciliate calculations,
- randomization of order executor,
- internal chat, mainly to inform everyone about delivery time.
